# A Builders' Code

> *In the elder days of Art,
Builders wrought with greatest care
Each minute and unseen part;
For the Gods see everywhere.

Else our lives are incomplete,
Standing in these walls of Time,
Broken stairways, where the feet
Stumble as they seek to climb.

Build to-day, then, strong and sure,
With a firm and ample base;
And ascending and secure
Shall to-morrow find its place.
— Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, 1850*

## Modularity

build upon the principle of decomposing the whole into that parts with defined boundaries (clear fences) as such one can minimise footprint of code base and intelligibly extend its behaviour

approach the essential structure of the problem through static primitives it is critical to distinguish the primitives that confer the greatest flexibility that translates into agility such that when extending said behaviour we do not compound needlessly the aggregate number of primitives

the path from conception to realisation is an annealing process. Code starts as a gas and ends as a metal. It must cool gradually under precise control. When parts cool too fast, flaws appear. Where flaws appear, the code must be reheated, rewritten.

## Navex in the Fog of War

write code courageously

all code was written by humans and can be mastered by humans. do not fear that which you do not yet understand venture forth from your islands of understanding. It's natural to feel fear of code; however, you must act as though you are able to master and change any part of it. To code courageously is to walk into any abyss, bring light, and make it right.

write code that reveals the most about the problem you are working on first to steer the ship in the fog

write code to reflect your current understanding of a problem but never poorly as a refraction of constraints or in other words ...

if there's clearly a right way to do something and a wrong way, do it the right way. Coding requires discipline. Anything that can be solved by discipline is not a real problem.

write code with sovereignty that enables other's to maneuver through with autonomy

> “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”
― Harold Abelson
> 

If you don't understand a system you're using, you don't control it and can’t mould it. If nobody understands the system, the system is in control.

write code that reduces to simplicity and attempts at manifesting [elegance](https://github.com/mkirchner/linked-list-good-taste#a-more-elegant-solution) 

> That's been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains. — Steve Jobs

Strip away the inessential and bolt out the bloat before it becomes mud.

### Extinguish Complexity X Relinquish Control X Emancipate Capacity

Its no longer command and control but liberating well defined structures to be scaled and built upon by others. Visibility, autonomy, tractability and explorability. 

```
 The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and behaviors should be. Think of the internet - to live, it (a) has to allow many different kinds of ideas and realizations that are beyond any single standard (Bed of Procrustes) and (b) to allow varying degrees of safe interoperability between these ideas.
